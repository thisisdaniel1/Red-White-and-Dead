# Red-White-and-Dead
A zombie horror survival first-person shooter game set during the American Revolution, during the years of 1781-1782. The player is assigned a squad of AI soldiers, each armed with a musket and bayonet. Their ammo is infinite, but swapping the reloading troops with ready ones will make positioning key!
